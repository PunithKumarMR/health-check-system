## 🩺 About

The **Health Check System** is an automated, parallel health-check platform built in **Go** for large-scale network environments.  
It performs concurrent health checks across routers, switches, and servers with intelligent session management, real-time tracking, and built-in failover handling — designed for internal use at **Airtel**.
# Health Check System

Automated parallel health check system for network nodes using Go.

## Overview

This system performs health checks on network nodes (routers, switches, servers) in parallel using:
- **User Pool Management**: 10 NIAM users × 5 sessions = 50 concurrent checks
- **Multi-hop SSH**: Mito Proxy → NIAM Proxy → Target Node
- **Failover Support**: 4 Mito proxies + 4 App servers with automatic failover
- **Real-time Status Tracking**: Monitor progress and health of all checks
- **Database-driven**: Dynamic inventory and configuration

## Quick Start

### 1. Database Setup
```bash
mysql -h 103.170.144.21 -u root -pmito mito_inventory < scripts/setup_database.sql
```

### 2. Configuration
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with actual passwords
nano .env
```

### 3. Build & Run
```bash
go mod tidy
go build -o health-check-system cmd/main.go
./health-check-system
```

## Architecture
